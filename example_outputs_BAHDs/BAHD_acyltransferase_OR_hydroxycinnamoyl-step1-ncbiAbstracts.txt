Title: Identification and characterization of the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the neurotoxin β-ODAP in grass pea.
Tag: Initial
Abstract: Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a grain legume commonly grown in Asia and Africa for food and forage. It is a highly nutritious and robust crop, capable of surviving both droughts and floods. However, it produces a neurotoxic compound, β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), which can cause a severe neurological disorder when consumed as a primary diet component. While the catalytic activity associated with β-ODAP formation was demonstrated more than 50 years ago, the enzyme responsible for this activity has not been identified. Here, we report on the identity, activity, 3D structure, and phylogenesis of this enzyme-β-ODAP synthase (BOS). We show that BOS belongs to the benzylalcohol O-acetyltransferase, anthocyanin O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase, deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase superfamily of acyltransferases and is structurally similar to hydroxycinnamoyl transferase. Using molecular docking, we propose a mechanism for its catalytic activity, and using heterologous expression in tobacco leaves (Nicotiana benthamiana), we demonstrate that expression of BOS in the presence of its substrates is sufficient for β-ODAP production in vivo. The identification of BOS may pave the way toward engineering β-ODAP-free grass pea cultivars, which are safe for human and animal consumption.

Title: Identification and characterization of a set of monocot BAHD monolignol transferases.
Tag: Initial
Abstract: Plant BAHD acyltransferases perform a wide range of enzymatic tasks in primary and secondary metabolism. Acyl-CoA monolignol transferases, which couple a CoA substrate to a monolignol creating an ester linkage, represent a more recent class of such acyltransferases. The resulting conjugates may be used for plant defense but are also deployed as important "monomers" for lignification, in which they are incorporated into the growing lignin polymer chain. p-Coumaroyl-CoA monolignol transferases (PMTs) increase the production of monolignol p-coumarates, and feruloyl-CoA monolignol transferases (FMTs) catalyze the production of monolignol ferulate conjugates. We identified putative FMT and PMT enzymes in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and have compared their activities to those of known monolignol transferases. The putative FMT enzymes produced both monolignol ferulate and monolignol p-coumarate conjugates, whereas the putative PMT enzymes produced monolignol p-coumarate conjugates. Enzyme activity measurements revealed that the putative FMT enzymes are not as efficient as the rice (Oryza sativa) control OsFMT enzyme under the conditions tested, but the SbPMT enzyme is as active as the control OsPMT enzyme. These putative FMTs and PMTs were transformed into Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to test their activities and abilities to biosynthesize monolignol conjugates for lignification in planta. The presence of ferulates and p-coumarates on the lignin of these transformants indicated that the putative FMTs and PMTs act as functional feruloyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA monolignol transferases within plants.

Title: Exploiting the Substrate Promiscuity of Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:Shikimate Hydroxycinnamoyl Transferase to Reduce Lignin.
Tag: Initial
Abstract: Lignin poses a major challenge in the processing of plant biomass for agro-industrial applications. For bioengineering purposes, there is a pressing interest in identifying and characterizing the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of lignin. Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT; EC 2.3.1.133) is a key metabolic entry point for the synthesis of the most important lignin monomers: coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. In this study, we investigated the substrate promiscuity of HCT from a bryophyte (Physcomitrella) and from five representatives of vascular plants (Arabidopsis, poplar, switchgrass, pine and Selaginella) using a yeast expression system. We demonstrate for these HCTs a conserved capacity to acylate with p-coumaroyl-CoA several phenolic compounds in addition to the canonical acceptor shikimate normally used during lignin biosynthesis. Using either recombinant HCT from switchgrass (PvHCT2a) or an Arabidopsis stem protein extract, we show evidence of the inhibitory effect of these phenolics on the synthesis of p-coumaroyl shikimate in vitro, which presumably occurs via a mechanism of competitive inhibition. A structural study of PvHCT2a confirmed the binding of a non-canonical acceptor in a similar manner to shikimate in the active site of the enzyme. Finally, we exploited in Arabidopsis the substrate flexibility of HCT to reduce lignin content and improve biomass saccharification by engineering transgenic lines that overproduce one of the HCT non-canonical acceptors. Our results demonstrate conservation of HCT substrate promiscuity and provide support for a new strategy for lignin reduction in the effort to improve the quality of plant biomass for forage and cellulosic biofuels.
